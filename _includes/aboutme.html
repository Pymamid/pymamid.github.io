        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a rising second-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> department at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/Theophilus%20Benson.html" target="_blank">Prof. Theophilus Benson</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Research Interests</h4>
        <p>
            My work lies at the intersection of operating systems and networking! My current research is focused on designing frameworks and runtimes that simplify the lifecycle of eBPF programs — from deployment to coordination to state sharing — so that developers can more easily extend the kernel with observability tools, transport mechanisms, and other enhancements.
        </p>

        <h4>Previously</h4>
        <p>
            I completed my undergraduate studies from <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/" target="_blank"> IIT Hyderabad</a>, where I dabbled in diverse domains ranging from astrophysics to theoretical computer science. Some of my most formative experiences included working on pulsars with the <a href="https://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/" target="_blank">Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope</a>, traveling to Japan for a research internship that ultimately inspired me to pursue a PhD, and working in the <a href="https://www.netxiith.in/" target="_blank">NetX lab</a> with <a href="https://praveenabt.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Praveen Tammana</a>. 
        </p>

        <h4>Outside Academics</h4>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy books, movies, and exploring new places. I'm picking up table tennis these days, and it's been a good way to relax. I also love practicing and teaching yoga, and I feel lucky to share it with the CMU community.
